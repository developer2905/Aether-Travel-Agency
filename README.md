🚀 Excited to share my latest Database Management System project! 🚀

I've just completed a front-end and database project for my college coursework, with the help of Aarya Gaonkar and Anushka Gavankar, and I'm thrilled to share the results with my network. This project was a comprehensive exercise in building a functional web application from scratch, featuring a sleek front-end and a powerful back-end database.

## Key aspects of the project include:

1.Front-End: Crafted using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive and responsive user interface. 🌐💻

2.Database: Developed with MySQL to handle and manage data effectively. 🗄📊

3.Integration: Seamlessly connected the front-end with the back-end to ensure smooth data flow and user interactions. 🔗⚙

This project has significantly enhanced my skills in web development and database management. It was a rewarding experience to see how design and functionality come together to create an effective application.


### Special thanks to Aarya Gaonkar and Anushka Gavankar for their incredible support and collaboration on this project!
